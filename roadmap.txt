Meet with Nevena and Carly to see how far Carly is

Dr. Burke Greer from PowWow Energy did for 2 central valley counties
	recreate one from those
	do a new one for SB

Comments from Dr. Greer
	After meeting with you I’ve done a bit of digging about when the CalETa dataset might be publicly available. The short story is that I’ll know more next week and will keep you in the loop. I might add though that comparisons between your sensor network at the CIMIS station ET0 and calculated ETc (ETa estimated from a Kc table) would be just as valuable and is another important layer. Especially because CIMIS is the de facto method most growers or UC ANR are using to estimate ET (outside of their own weather stations). In fact, the CIMIS ET0 is a “spatial” product like the CalETa (though the raw data may not be as pretty on a slide and is at 2 km spatial resolution).

Regional ET data can be collected from CIMIS -----> https://cimis.water.ca.gov/SpatialData.aspx

	suggested to start at CEC team-wide meeting notes ("To Measure it Exactly")

An idea of a good project as reflected from conversation between Prof. Krintz and Dr. Greer ----->
	a good project would be to compare computation of ETa from local measurements (a bunch of different ones perhaps, temp, humidity, water vapor pressure, solar radiation) against ETa estimates from CIMIS as a good first step (how close to CIMIS can we get?)

Notations ----->
	ET_o - Reference ET for a short crop having an approximate height of 0.12 m (similar to grass)
	ET_c - ET in cultivated crops
	K_c - Crop Coefficient (ET_c = K_c * ET_o)
