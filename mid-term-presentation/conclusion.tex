\item 4 features used in equation, do the other 12 have significant effect on ET?
\item Can the dimensionality of dataset be reduced using PCA/LDA?
\item Given one (or more, but not all) sensor value at a particular place, how well can we estimate ET by taking into account other sensor values for nearby stations?
\item Integrate web interface for analysis.
\item Cross check with ground truth value of other sources (\textit{Problem:} features seem to be different?)
